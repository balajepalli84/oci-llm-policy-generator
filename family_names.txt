# OCI IAM Policy Language – Resource Families and Context

**LLM Training Prompt (Single Page)**

This document defines **Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) IAM resource families**, their **purpose**, and the **resource-type vocabulary** associated with each family.
Resource families are **aggregate policy targets**. Granting access to a family grants access to all included resource-types.

Policies follow this grammar:

```
allow <subject> to <verb> <resource-type or family> in <location> where <conditions>
```

## Key Training Notes (Critical)

* Family names are **policy shortcuts**, not API resources.
* Families expand to individual resource-types at evaluation time.
* Most services support **only general variables** unless explicitly listed.
* Verb semantics (`inspect`, `read`, `use`, `manage`) are **consistent across families**.

---

If you want, next we can:

* Convert this into **JSON training data**
* Add **verb-to-permission mappings**
* Add **negative examples** (what a family does NOT cover)
* Normalize this for **RAG ingestion**

Tell me the next step and we will move forward.
